# üëÅ Viz Data & Models

## [**Chapter 7.** Visualizing data and models](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-7/)

## This chapter covers

- How to use `tfjs-vis` to perform **custom data visualization**
- How to **peek at the internal workings of models** after they are trained and gain **useful insights**

## Summary

- We studied the basic usage of `tfjs-vis`, a visualization library tightly integrated with TensorFlow.js. It can be used to render basic types of charts in the browser.
- **Visualizing data is an indispensable part of machine learning**. 
  - **Efficient and effective presentation of data** can reveal patterns and provide insights that are otherwise hard to obtain, as we showed by using the *Jena-weather-archive data*.
- Rich **patterns and insights can be extracted from trained neural networks**.
- We showed the **steps and results of Visualizing the internal-layer activations of a deep convnet**.
- **Calculating what the layers are maximally responsive to**.
- **Determining which parts of an input image are most relevant to the convnet‚Äôs classification decision**.
  - These **help us understand what is learned by the convnet and how it operates during inference**.
