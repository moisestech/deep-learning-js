## **Vocabulary**

- **[`meanAbsoluteError`](https://medium.com/@ewuramaminka/mean-absolute-error-mae-machine-learning-ml-b9b4afc63077)** - refers to the mean of the absolute values of each prediction error on all instances of the test data-set.
  - Prediction error is the difference between the actual value and the predicted value for that instance.
- **outliers** - An outlier is a data point that is distant from other similar points. They may be due to variability in the measurement or may indicate experimental errors. If possible, outliers should be excluded from the data set. However, detecting that anomalous instances might be very difficult, and is not always possible.
