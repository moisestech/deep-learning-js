## **Vocabulary**

- **data normalization**
  - Batch normalization is a technique for training very deep neural networks that standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch.
  - This has the effect of stabilizing the learning process and dramatically reducing the number of training epochs required to train deep networks.
- **normalize**
- **standard transformation**
  - **z-score normalization**
- **rank-2 tensor**
- **`determineMeansAndStddev`**
- **samples**
- **feature**
- **repeating**
- **broadcast axes**
