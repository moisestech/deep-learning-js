# ðŸª€ 2 LINEAR REGRESS

## [**Chapter 2.** Getting started: Simple linear regression in TensorFlow.js](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-2/)

## This Chapter Covers

- A minimal example of a **neural network** for the simple machine-learning task of **linear regression**.
- **Tensors** and **tensor operations**.
- Basic neural network **optimization**.

---

## **Vocabulary**

- **neural network** - A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers. ... Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name "deep" networks.
