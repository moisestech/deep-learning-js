# ðŸª€ 2 LINEAR REGRESS

## [**Chapter 2.** Getting started: Simple linear regression in TensorFlow.js](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-2/)

## This Chapter Covers

- A minimal example of a **neural network** for the simple machine-learning task of **linear regression**.
- **Tensors** and **tensor operations**.
- Basic neural network **optimization**.

## **Vocabulary**

- **neural network** - A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
  - Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name "deep" networks.
- **linear regression** - A neural network can be a linear regressor too, if you remove all hidden layers, and all the activation functions, then it is fundamentally still a neural network, only that its the simplest possible NN.
  - In this case, it would be just a collection of perceptrons ( minus the activations).
- **tensors** - A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions.
  - Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.
  - When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object you manipulate and pass around is the tf$Tensor.
