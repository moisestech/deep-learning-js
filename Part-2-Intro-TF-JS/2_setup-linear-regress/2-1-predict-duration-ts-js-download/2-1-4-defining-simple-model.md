## **Vocabulary**

- **simple model** - A linear regression model with one layer. For example a dense layers with tunable weights on the kernel and bias.
- **deep learning** - Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
- **model** - is represented by its architecture that shows how to transform two or more inputs into an output.
  - The transformation is given in the form of a learning algorithm.
- **regression** - Regression ANNs predict an output variable as a function of the inputs. If the output variable is a categorical variable (or binary) the ANN will function as a classifier.
