## **Vocabulary**

- <b>simple model</b>
  - A linear regression model with one layer. For example a dense layers with tunable weights on the kernel and bias.
- <b>deep learning</b>
  - Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
  - Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
- <b>model</b>
  - is represented by its architecture that shows how to transform two or more inputs into an output.
  - The transformation is given in the form of a learning algorithm.
- <b>regression</b>
  - Regression ANNs predict an output variable as a function of the inputs.
  - If the output variable is a categorical variable (or binary) the ANN will function as a classifier.
- <b>classification</b>
  - Classification neural networks used for feature categorization are very similar to fault-diagnosis networks, except that they only allow one output response for any input pattern, instead of allowing multiple faults to occur for a given set of operating conditions.
- <b>tunable</b>
- <b>building blocks</b>
