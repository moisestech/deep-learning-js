# ðŸª€ Using Trained Model

## **Vocabulary**

- [**`predict()`**](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.LayersModel.predict)
  - both `tf.LayersModel` and `tf.GraphModel` provide the unified `predict()` method to support inference.
  - This method takes one or more tensors as in put and returns one or more tensors as the inference result.
- **`inputShape`**
  - It's the starting tensor you send to the first hidden layer.
  - This tensor must have the same shape as your training data.
  - Example: if you have 30 images of 50x50 pixels in RGB (3 channels), the shape of your input data is (30,50,50,3).
- [**`fit()`**](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.LayersModel.fit)
  - Trains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations on a dataset).
