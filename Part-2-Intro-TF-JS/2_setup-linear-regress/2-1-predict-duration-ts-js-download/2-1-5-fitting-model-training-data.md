## **Vocabulary**

- **`evaluate()`**
  - method calculates the loss function as applied to the provided example features and targets.
  - Does not update the modelâ€™s weights.
  - We use evaluate() to estimate the quality of the model on the test data, so as to get an idea about how the model would perform in the future application.
- **`fit()`**
  - Function fitting is the process of training a neural network on a set of inputs in order to produce an associated set of target outputs.
  - After you construct the network with the desired hidden layers and the training algorithm, you must train it using a set of training data.
- **mean absolute error (MAE)**
  - The MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts, without considering their direction.
  - It measures accuracy for continuous variables.
- **chaining API**
- **tf namespace**
- **underfitting**
  - A model is said to be underfitting when it's not even able to classify the data it was trained on, let alone data it hasn't seen before.
  - A model is said to be underfitting when it's not able to classify the data it was trained on.
- **overfitting**
