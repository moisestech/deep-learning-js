## **Vocabulary**

- **Phishing Website dataset**
- **predicting**
  - refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn in 30 days.
- **phishing detection**
- **binary cross entropy**
  - Also called Sigmoid Cross-Entropy loss.
  - It is a Sigmoid activation plus a Cross-Entropy loss.
  - Unlike Softmax loss it is independent for each vector component (class), meaning that the loss computed for every CNN output vector component is not affected by other component values.
