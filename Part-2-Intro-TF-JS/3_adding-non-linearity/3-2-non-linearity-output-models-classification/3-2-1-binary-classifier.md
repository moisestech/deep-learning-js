## **Vocabulary**

- <b>Phishing Website dataset</b>
- <b>predicting</b>
  - refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn in 30 days.
- <b>phishing detection</b>
- <b>binary cross entropy</b>
  - Also called Sigmoid Cross-Entropy loss.
  - It is a Sigmoid activation plus a Cross-Entropy loss.
  - Unlike Softmax loss it is independent for each vector component (class), meaning that the loss computed for every CNN output vector component is not affected by other component values.
