## **Vocabulary**

- <b>entropy</b>
  - Entropy is a measure of disorder or uncertainty and the goal of machine learning models and Data Scientists in general is to reduce uncertainty.
  - This is called Information Gain.
  - The greater the reduction in this uncertainty, the more information is gained about Y from X.
  - Entropy, as it relates to machine learning, is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed.
  - The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw any conclusions from that information.
- <b>binaryCrossentropy</b>
  - [**`binaryCrossentropy`**](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#metrics.binaryCrossentropy) - Binary cross-entropy metric function.
  - Parameters:
    - `yTrue (tf.Tensor)` Binary Tensor of truth.
    - `yPred (tf.Tensor)` Binary Tensor of prediction, probabilities for the 1 case.
    - Returns: `tf.Tensor`
- <b>thresholding function</b>
- <b>step function</b>
- <b>limitations</b>
- <b>epsilon, fudge factor</b>
- <b>`truthLabel`</b>
- <b>`measSquaredError`</b>
