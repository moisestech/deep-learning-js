## **Vocabulary**

- **dense layer** - What is a dense neural network? Each neuron in a layer receives an input from all the neurons present in the previous layer—thus, they're densely connected. In other words, the dense layer is a fully connected layer, meaning all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in the next layer.
- **trained models** - A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm. ... The training model is used to run the input data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output. The result from this correlation is used to modify the model. This iterative process is called “model fitting”.
