## **Vocabulary**

- <b>dense layer</b>
  - What is a dense neural network? Each neuron in a layer receives an input from all the neurons present in the previous layer—thus, they're densely connected.
  - In other words, the dense layer is a fully connected layer, meaning all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in the next layer.
- <b>trained models/b>
  - A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm.
  - The training model is used to run the input data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output.
  - The result from this correlation is used to modify the model.
  - This iterative process is called “model fitting”.
- <b>data</b>
  - data cleaning, data engineering, data analysis.
