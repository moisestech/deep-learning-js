# Adding Non-Linearity

## [**Chapter 3.** Adding nonlinearity: Beyond weighted sums](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-3/)

## This chapter covers

- What nonlinearity is and how nonlinearity in hidden layers of a neural network enhances the networkâ€™s capacity and leads to better prediction accuracies
- What hyperparameters are and methods for tuning them
- Binary classification through nonlinearity at the output layer, introduced with the phishing-website-detection example
- Multiclass classification and how it differs from binary classification, introduced with the iris-flower example
