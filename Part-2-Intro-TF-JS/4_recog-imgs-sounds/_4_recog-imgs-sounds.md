- What convnets are, how they work, and why they are especially suitable for machine-learning tasks involving images
- How to write and train a convnet in TensorFlow.js to solve the task of classifying hand-written digits
- How to train models in Node.js to achieve faster training speeds
- How to use convnets on audio data for spoken-word recognition
