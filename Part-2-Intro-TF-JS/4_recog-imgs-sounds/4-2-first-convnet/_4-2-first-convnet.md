## **Vocabulary**

- **CNNs**: Convolutional neural network. That is, a network which has at least one convolutional layer. A typical CNN also includes other types of layers, such as pooling layers and dense layers.
- **Convolution** - The process of applying a kernel (filter) to an image
- **Kernel / filter** - A matrix which is smaller than the input, used to transform the input into chunks
- **image data** -
- **neural network** -
- **MNIST** -
- **output** -
- **one-hot encoding** -
- **sound** -
- **function** -
- **layers** -
- **sequential** -
- **`add()`** -
- **method** -
- **repeating** -
- **feature** -
- **Padding** - Adding pixels of some value, usually 0, around the input image
- **convolutional kernel** -
- **nonlinearity** -
- **Pooling** - The process of reducing the size of an image through downsampling.There are several types of pooling layers. For example, average pooling converts many values into a single value by taking the average. However, max-pooling is the most common.
- **Max-pooling** - A pooling process in which many values are converted into a single value by taking the maximum value from among them.
- **Stride** - the number of pixels to slide the kernel (filter) across the image.
- **space** -
- **dense layers** -
- **conv2d** -
- **Downsampling** - The act of reducing the size of an image
