# ðŸŸ¦ Transfer Learning

## [**Chapter 5.** Transfer learning: Reusing pretrained neural networks](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-5/)

## This chapter covers

- What transfer learning is and why it is better than training models from scratch for many types of problems
- How to leverage the feature-extraction power of state-of-the-art pretrained convnets by converting them from Keras to TensorFlow.js
- The detailed mechanisms of transfer-learning techniques including layer freezing, creating new transfer heads, and fine-tuning
- How to use transfer learning to train a simple object-detection model in TensorFlow.js
