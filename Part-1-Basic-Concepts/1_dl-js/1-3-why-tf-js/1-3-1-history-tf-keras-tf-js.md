## **Vocabulary**

- **TensorFlow, Keras** - The LEGO equivalent is the high-level API called Keras.
  - Keras provides a set of the most frequently used types of neural network layers, each with configurable parameters.
- **tensors** - A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions.
  - Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.
  - When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object you manipulate and pass around is the tf$Tensor.
- **graph** - Graph Neural Network is a type of Neural Network which directly operates on the Graph structure.
  - A typical application of GNN is node classification.
  - Essentially, every node in the graph is associated with a label, and we want to predict the label of the nodes without ground-truth .
- **sequence tasks** - Neural Networks sequentially build high-level features through their successive layers. We propose here a new neural network model where each layer is associated with a set of candidate mappings.
