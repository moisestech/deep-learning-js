## **Vocabulary**

- **symbolic AI**
  - Symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on **high-level "symbolic" (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search**.
  - One popular form of symbolic AI is expert systems, which uses a network of production rules.
- **subfield of AI**
  - AI has inter-related scientific and engineering goals.
  - Major sub-fields of AI now include: **Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computation, Vision, Robotics, Expert Systems, Speech Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Planning**.
- **decision trees**
- **layers**
