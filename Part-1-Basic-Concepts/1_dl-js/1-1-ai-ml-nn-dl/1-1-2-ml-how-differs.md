## **Vocabulary**

- [**traditional programming**](https://www.logianalytics.com/predictive-analytics/machine-learning-vs-traditional-programming/#:~:text=Traditional%20Programming%20refers%20to%20any,of%20intelligence%20and%20embedded%20analytics.) - refers to any manually created program that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output.
- **[features](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)>)** - a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression. Useful features is what helps drive model predictions.
