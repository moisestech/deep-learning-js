## **Vocabulary**

- [**traditional programming**](https://www.logianalytics.com/predictive-analytics/machine-learning-vs-traditional-programming/#:~:text=Traditional%20Programming%20refers%20to%20any,of%20intelligence%20and%20embedded%20analytics.) - refers to any manually created program that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output.
- **[features](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)>)** - a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression. Useful features is what helps drive model predictions.
- **output** - (phi) is the transfer function (commonly a threshold function). The output is analogous to the axon of a biological neuron, and its value propagates to the input of the next layer, through a synapse. It may also exit the system, possibly as part of an output vector.
- [**binary**](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/binary-neural-networks.html#:~:text=Binary%20neural%20networks%20are%20networks,are%20stored%20in%20full%20precision.) - Binary neural networks are networks with binary weights and activations at run time. At training time these weights and activations are used for computing gradients; however, the gradients and true weights are stored in full precision.
- **array** - The central unit of data in TensorFlow.js is the tf.Tensor: a set of values shaped into an array of one or more dimensions. tf.Tensors are very similar to multidimensional arrays.
- **RGB (red-green-blue)** -
- **labels** -
- **predictions** -
- **training** -
- **hypothesis space** -
- **training phase** -
- **dataset** -
- **HSV (hue-saturation-value)** -
- **kernel methods** -
