## **Vocabulary**

- **[Artificial neural networks** - usually simply called **neural networks (NNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)**, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
- **Layers** - layers are usually stacked on top of each other with connections only between adjacent ones. A layer of neural networks is similar to a mathematical function in that it is a mapping from an input value to an output value.
- **Weights** - are a set of numeral values that belong to the layer and govern the details of how each input representation is transformed by the layer into an output representation.
- **matrix** - A matrix is a collection of numbers arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Usually the numbers are real numbers.
- **vector** -
- **loss function** -
- **gradient descent** -
- **naives bayes classifier** -
- **logistic regression (logreg)** -
- **kernel methods** -
- **tackle binary** -

- **gradient** -
- **Kaggle** -
- **backpropagation** -
- **feature engineering** -
