## **Vocabulary**

- **basic ideas** - Neural networks already existed as early as the 1980s, and 3 key technical forces in 30 years drove the 2012 AI revolution that we are experiencing today.
- **benchmarks** - Catalyst for the rise of deep learning is the ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1.4 million images that have been hand annotated with 1,000 image categories. Through Kaggle having common benchmarks that researchers compete to beat has greatly helped the recent rise of deep learning.
