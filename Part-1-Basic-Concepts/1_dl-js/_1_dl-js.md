## [**Chapter 1.** Deep learning and JavaScript](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-1/)

## This Chapter Covers

- What **deep learning** is and how it is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
- **What makes deep learning stand out** among various machine-learning techniques, and the factors that led to the current ‚Äúdeep-learning revolution‚Äù
- The reasons for doing deep learning in JavaScript using **TensorFlow.js**
- The overall organization of this book

---

## **Summary**

- AI is the **study of automating cognitive tasks**.
  - Machine learning is a subfield of AI in which **rules** for performing a task such as image classification are **discovered automatically by learning from examples in the training data**.
- A **central problem** in machine learning is how to transform the original representation of data into a **representation more amenable to solving the task**.
- **Neural networks** are an approach in machine learning wherein the **transformation of data** representation is **performed by successive steps (or layers) of mathematical operations**. 
  - The field of **deep learning** concerns deep neural networks‚Äî neural networks with **many layers**.
- Thanks to enhancements in **hardware**, increased availability of **labeled data**, and **advances in algorithms**, the field of deep learning has made astonishing progress since the early 2010s, **solving previously unsolvable problems** and creating exciting new opportunities.
- **JavaScript** and the web browser are a **suitable environment** for deploying and training deep neural networks.
- TensorFlow.js, the focus of this book, is a comprehensive, versatile, and **powerful open source library for deep learning in JavaScript**.
