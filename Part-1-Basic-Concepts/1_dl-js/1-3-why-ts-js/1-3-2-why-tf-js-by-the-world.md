## **Vocabulary**

- **trained model** - Models trained on a high amount of data can generalize themselves better.
  - Generalization is the ability of a model to give generalized predictions across varied or diverse data.
  - It is not biased towards the data on which it was originally trained.
- **TensorFlow.js model** - In machine learning, a model is a function with learnable parameters that maps an input to an output. The optimal parameters are obtained by training the model on data. A well-trained model will provide an accurate mapping from the input to the desired output. In TensorFlow.
