# ðŸ’Š Deploy TF.js Model on on Plats Env

## [**12.3.** Deploying TensorFlow.js models on various platforms and environments](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-javascript/chapter-12/161)

- Youâ€™ve optimized your model, itâ€™s fast and lightweight, and all your tests are green. Youâ€™re good to go! Hooray! But before you pop that champagne, thereâ€™s a bit more work to do.

- Itâ€™s time to put your model into your application and get it out in front of your user base. In this section, we will cover a few deployment platforms. Deploying to the web and deploying to a Node.js service are well-known paths, but weâ€™ll also cover a few more exotic deployment scenarios, like deploying to a browser extension or a single-board embedded hardware application. We will point to simple examples and discuss special considerations important for the platforms.
